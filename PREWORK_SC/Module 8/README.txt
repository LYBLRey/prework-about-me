1) Started by putting Header (h1) brackets for "Boo The Dog Fan Page"
which made the text px bigger, bold, and in white font-color.

2) Deleted the instructions code (not error but unnecessary for final code)

3) Made proper paragraphs (spacing) for the info/bio of Boo The Dog by using <p>


4) Moved </div> which WAS after <div class="panel-body">, after all the paragraphs from the bio

5) Googled "boo the dog wikipedia" copied the URL, added it in between the a href= quotations

6) Added < before img and > at the end of the img URL so the image would properly show up

7) Rearranged code so Grow/Shrink is top left, Color change is top right, Random facts is bottom left, Favorite's List is bottom right

8) Changed booFacts to booFactArray in logic.js file

9) Added quotations to "pink" in logic.js file

10) Added quotations then " after each random fact in the List in logic.js file

11) Added quotations to "click" in the logic.js textGreen function

12) in html file, added <li></li> to each thing in between <ol></ol> to make it an ordered list

13) Made sure all indents were correct, especially the <div> ones

14) changed "errors.js" to "logic.js" 

15) was saving and testing in browser after each step, it was relieving to find that the cs 
wasn't working because it was called error instead of logic, everything now works perfectly 
as expected! YAY
